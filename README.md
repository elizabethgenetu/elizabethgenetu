## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate and high-achieving student from Ethiopia, currently entering Grade 11. With a strong foundation in mathematics, computer science, and robotics, I thrive in environments where curiosity meets creativity.

My journey into programming began with the **AddisCoder 2023** program, where I was introduced to Python, algorithms, and computational thinking. That experience sparked my interest in technology and problem-solving and set me on a path toward **computer engineering** and **graphics development**.

In 2025, I was accepted into the **Yale Young African Scholars (YYAS)** program—an elite initiative that connects promising African students to academic enrichment, leadership training, and global mentorship.
